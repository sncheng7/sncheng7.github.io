## About

I’m Shuning Cheng, a University Counselor & League Secretary at the College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I support **over 1,000 students** with day-to-day advising across academics, well-being, and career planning, and I organize activities and outreach. 

I led a **Counselor Studio** initiative that introduced a grid-based workflow and a plan–implementation–feedback–reimplementation cycle to improve communication and student support. 

I’m currently preparing to **apply for a PhD in Education**. My current research interest is how **generative AI** can support **personalized psychological counseling** in higher education—helping more students get timely support and better results, while respecting ethics and privacy.
